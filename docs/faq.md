# FAQ
## Can Preppy be used in production?
Technically yes, realistically no. Preppy is intended to create machines for competitive environments like CCDC or CyberConquest. As such, it intentionally leaves systems with default or vulnerable configurations. I recommend setting up a custom-tailored script if you need to build a large-scale environment. 

## Why Ruby? Why not Bash?
Ruby combines the power of scripting languages with genuine object-orientated methods and other modern features. In fact, Ruby interops with Bash quite nicely, since it has strong, built-in command line interaction. Plus I don't trust a large project with an if statement that looks like this `if [[x -lt 2]]`

## What about Python? 
It's personal preference. I don't really like indenting as the sole dictator for blocks of code.
